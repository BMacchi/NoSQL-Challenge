# NoSQL-Challenge

Instructions/Scenario

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

FYI - The json file was rather large so I couldn't upload it here. The JSON file contents were uploaded to MongoDB Compass which enabled me to splice and analyze the data as needed for the assignment.
